# Research & ML Experiments

This directory contains research, experiments, and results related to the ML models used in FPL Geek.

## Structure

- **experiments/**: Contains scripts and notebooks for running specific experiments.
- **results/**: Stores the output of experiments, such as model metrics, feature importance plots, and predictions.
- **logs/**: Contains execution logs for tracking long-running training jobs or experiments.

## Guidelines

- When running a new experiment, create a new subdirectory in `experiments/` or a new script with a descriptive name.
- Save the results of important experiments in `results/`, preferably with a timestamp or experiment ID.
- Document the findings of each major experiment in a markdown file within `experiments/` or `results/`.
